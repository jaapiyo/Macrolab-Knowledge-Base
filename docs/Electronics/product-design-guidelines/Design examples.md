## Electrical power entry (IEC C14)
A lot of our products are made to connect directly to the 230 V electrical power supply. This way no bulky power adapters are necessary which can get lost. Also we have more control over the quality of the dc voltage by using specifically rated power supplies that have load regulation and the right kind of noise filtering.

Schurter makes a really nice series of power entry modules called D11. There are many variants and it's not always clear which one to use. See a few selected models below:

| Mfg. part nr   | Description                         | Switch | Fuse   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| DD11.0113.1111 | Red illumination 10A with cover     | 2 pole | 1 pole |
| 4301.1409      | Fuseholder with room for spare fuse | -      | 1 pole |

Another option, for when no fuse is needed is the DC11.

| Mfg. part nr  | Description                   | Switch |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------ |
| DC11.0021.001 | Red illumination without fuse | 2 pole |
