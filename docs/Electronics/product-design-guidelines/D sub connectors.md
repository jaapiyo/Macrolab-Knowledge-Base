The D-subminiature (D-sub) is a commonly used connector in our lab. They are named after their characteristic D-shaped metal shield.


## Types and configurations
Originally [Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_(company)) introduced the series of connectors in 1952 with a part numbering system starting with a *D*, followed by one of *A*, *B*, *C*, *D* or *E*, denoting the shell size. This was followed by the number of pins or sockets and either *P* (plug) or *S* (socket) denoting the gender of the part.


| Type | Configuration          |
| ---- | ---------------------- |
| DA15 | 15 pin, shell size *A* |
| DB25 | 25 pin, shell size *B* |
| DC37 | 37 pin, shell size *C* |
| DD50 | 50 pin, shell size *D* |
| DE9  | 9 pin, shell size *E*  |

Over the years the type designation has lost it's value a little bit because the naming convention is not always followed. When the DB-25 connector was replaced with a DE-9 for serial communications on personal computers it was often called DB-9 for instance. 

Manufacturers sometimes also use a number to denote shell-size.  For TE this is *1* for size *E* and *2* to *5* for shell sizes *A* up to *D*.
## TE Connectivity Amplimite HD-20
The HD-20[^1] series from TE is commonly used in our lab. We also have a crimping tool to fabricated connectors with crimped wire leads.

[^1]: HD-22 also exists and denotes the high-density variant.
### Panel mounting
When designing a panel cutout use the following dimensions:
