The Agilent U1731B is a handheld LCR meter. It has a optically isolated data interface that we can use to record measurements.

Here the value displayed on the device is '1496,33 uH'.

First packet is a bit different from the rest, possibily software version etc. Not yet sure. After that we see a regularly transmitted packet with the measurement value.

# Decoding
Kees van Beek wrote a piece of lua code that is capable of decoding the measurement value from this packet. See `AgilentU1731B.lua`

``` lua
f=string.sub(EStr,5,5)
Factor=math.pow(10,f)/1000
v=string.sub(EStr,5,10)
Waarde=tonumber(v)*Factor
```

It seems the packets are delimited with the `=` symbol.

The measured value is decoded in the 5th to the 10th character of each packet.
