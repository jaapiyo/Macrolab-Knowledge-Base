# Exporting a datafile
When recording data in Mp3, measurements are stored to disk in binary format with the extension `*.mdt`. These files can only be opened with specific software. 

In order to use the data for further analysis you must export this data. Exporting can be done by to `Tools` â†’ `Export datafile`. The `DataFile Export` window wil open.

The columns `Index`, `Date`, `Time` and `Counter` are always present. The rest of the columns depend on the profile setup in Mp3.

The `Index` value is an incremental number starting at 0 for the first sample.

The `Date` value denotes the number of days passed since 01-01-1900. The decimal part is in fractions of a full day.

The `Time` value denotes the number of seconds passed since 00:00 of the day in the `Date` field.

The `Counter` value indicates a number of counts that can be setup in the profile in Mp3.
