## Exclusion for internally used equipment

"Where the equipment has an assembly of linked, powered parts and where at least one of them moves for a specific application, then it will be defined as a machine under the Machinery Directive (2006/42/EC). Actually there are seven categories of equipment in all that are covered by the Machinery Directive and it states that _**“before placing machinery on the market and/or putting it into service, the manufacturer must… affix the CE marking**”_ (along with all of the other CE marking tasks)."
