According to ISO 12100:2010, drafting information for use is an integral part of the design of a machine. 
## Writing an instruction handbook

According to ISO 20607:2019 the content of a handbook shall be structured according to the following example. An instruction handbook for a user/operator doesn't need to contain all of these sections.
