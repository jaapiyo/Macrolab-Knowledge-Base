Welcome to the Macrolab knowledge base. Here you'll find a collection of information pieces, explainers, examples and more regarding technology used in our lab. The focus of this knowledge base is on [[Data-aquisition]] and [[Control systems]], however you will also find information on other related subjects.

# Stevin laboratory
The Macrolab is also known as the Stevin laboratory and is part of the faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at the TU Delft in the Netherlands.

At the Stevin laboratory some of the largest scale tests can be conducted in the Netherlands and sometimes the world. Among these exceptional tests it is possible for large scale concrete beams and plates to be tested in 1-, 2- and 3-point bending.
